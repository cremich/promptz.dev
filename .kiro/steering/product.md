# Product Overview

## Core Purpose

Promptz.dev is a comprehensive library and community platform for AI-assisted development, serving as the central hub for developers using Kiro, Kiro CLI, and Amazon Q Developer. The platform enables creation, discovery, and sharing of AI development resources across the entire software development lifecycle.

## Primary Content Types

- **Prompts**: AI instructions for specific development tasks (code generation, testing, documentation, architecture)
- **Steering Documents**: Configuration files that ensure AI assistants consistently follow established patterns, libraries, and standards
- **Custom Agents**: Specialized AI assistants for specific workflows and development processes
- **Agent Hooks**: Automation tools that execute predefined agent actions when specific IDE events occur
- **Kiro Powers**: Packaged tools, workflows, and best practices that Kiro can activate on-demand

## Target Audience

- Developers using Kiro, Kiro CLI, and Amazon Q Developer for AI-assisted development
- Development teams establishing coding standards and AI workflows
