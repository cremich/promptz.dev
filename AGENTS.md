# Development Workflow for AI Agents

## Task Planning

Before executing any task, you MUST complete these steps:

1. **Ask clarifying questions**
   - Identify any ambiguities in task description, design, or requirements
   - Ask specific questions to ensure you understand the expected outcome
   - Wait for the user to answer your questions before proceeding
   - Confirm your understanding before proceeding

2. **Research documentation**
   - Use your MCP tools to understand capabilities and limitations of relevant libraries and frameworks
   - Verify current best practices

3. **Plan your implementation**
   - Describe your approach and reasoning
   - List the tools and sources you'll use
   - Explain how you'll verify success
   - Wait for user confirmation before proceeding
